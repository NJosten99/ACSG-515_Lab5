For this project I opted to utilize an HTML template page to display the "Hello World!" message in bold.  To start the web app, you should 
first create a local clone of this repository.  Then, in your command line terminal, you should navigate to the Lab5 folder in the ACSG-515_Lab5 folder.  
The format of the path will be akin to "*your local pathing*/ACSG-515_Lab5/Lab5/".  Unfortunately, I was unable to find a way of accessing a 
local JSON file without defining its complete path.  Therefore, you will need to change line 13 in the views file in the home folder
to represent your individual pathing.  Then, while in the /ACSG-515_Lab5/Lab5/ folder, run the following terminal command:

python3 manage.py runserver

Finally, enter the address shown in the command line terminal into your browser's address bar and execute.  The address will likely be "http://127.0.0.1:8000/".
